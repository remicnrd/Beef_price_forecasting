# Beef_price_forecasting


This project has been done in a team of 3, and aim to produce a Beef price forecast using the following timeseries data: Ground beef price, Log price of beef and price inflation.

To do so, we have done some visual analysis, and produced several models (including Exponential Smoothing, Holt Linear trend method, Holt-Winters, and different ARMAs). Then the models were compared using the AICC test, the Mincer-Zarnowitz test and the Diebold-Mariano test.


PS: This project is an R notebook and some elements are not rendered properly, such as titles, graphs, and equations. I encourage you to download the Rmd file and open it with Rstudio for better readability.
